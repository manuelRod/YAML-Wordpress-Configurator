## YML WP Configurator
=====================
This plugin aims to easy the process of creating custom types of content.
For the first version it will allow creation of custom post types via YAML files.
In the future will allow to create any custom type of content available for WP, custom taxonomies, custom terms, etc.

## How to use it?
======================
Place your YML configuration file on configuration_files (example: post_types subfolder for custom post types)
You can find yml examples on examples folder. You can use them as a guide to create your own custom data.
File has to be compatible with this plugin (See examples folder) and be placed (FTP / SSH) on it proper place.
When ready, you need to be logged as Administrator and add ?yaml-register=true to the url. This way we avoid overload or unnecessary processing.
When done, you will see an output log with information about the process.

## Future Development
======================
Delete Custom types.
Add support for custom taxonomies and terms.
Create friendly interface?
You name it.
